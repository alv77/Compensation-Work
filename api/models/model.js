   At the moment the example resource has only a name. You can delete this property

   Task 1 - Part 1: Replace the Resource class with a new class of your choosing, that
   has at least three properties: one string property, one number property, one boolean
   property, and - optionally - a date property.
   Then, adapt the initialization of the data at the end of this file (Task 2 - Part 2)
   so that you have some instances of your object available that can be served to the client.
